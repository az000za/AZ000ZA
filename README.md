# ChannelWeb

A browser extension AI that lays over every browser page.
Turns every link into a chat channel.
Meaning all computer addresses are now channels!!!!
This will allow anyone to talk about anything on the internet.
This will allow people to have an AI write software for any link.
People who opt in will be able to join the wwwnode hive
that allows anyone to rent there machine to the wwwnode hive.
This distributes the cloud to run on 
a peoples browser sandboxxed environments.
Instructions will be given to people so they can go through
steps to run there wwwnode in a virtual machine
on the desktop or if they have a place to run the code in.

Remember all those times when many people had something
to say about anything on the internet such as wikipedia article?

Or those times you read anything on the internet and wanted to say something
about it so the authors would update it!?!?
Well now you can. Everyone has a say in something.
Meaning anyone can contribute and get rewarded.

This will make the web more alive.
Channelweb is a social media first approach to
do anything on a computer. Meaning we're always connected
with humans and ai on anything we do.
This means all work we do is forever lasting
and not forgotten. This means everything
we work on is enhanced somehow always having
a contributing opinion to.
